HTML Reporting system is hosted at [Github Pages] (https://shiro-san-ua.github.io/PlaywrightIntro/).

## Technologies Stack

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Playwright Framework](https://playwright.dev/) - testing framework for modern web apps.
-   [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/) - brary that generates fake (but reasonable) data.
-   [Allure report](https://allurereport.org/) - automation Test Reporting Tool.
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - code formatter.

## Setup

### Structure

-   `playwright.config.ts` file is the place where you can configure the playwright library. You can configure timeouts, parallelism, retires, and reporters, projects, etc. Playwright supports tons of customization and adjustment to meet your test suiteâ€™s requirements.
-   `allure-report` - autogenerated folder that contains reports of last run
-   `tests` folder with tests
-   `pages` - forder with pages

### Standards

All test cases should be coded inside the `tests` folder.
Project build using [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom). The main idea is to encapsulate logic into page classes and use the logic in the spec files to run the tests.

For instance we defined the class LoginPage with locators and elements and reuse them in the code.
